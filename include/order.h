// this is where i will define variables and functions
// for the order class (order.cpp)

/*

Each order will have the following tied to it  

Name ("John Smith"), Location ("B1") *maybe not a str?* , Date pickup ("8-25-23"), 
Date placed in pickup ("7-21-23"), 

Can also have functions for Days since set for pickup, everything should be using the current system time
for things like date.
