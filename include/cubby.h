// This is where i will define variables and functions
// needed for the cubby.cpp class 
/*

A cubby is a part of the shelf.

a Cubby will hold orders, the cubby class represents one spot in an array of cubbies

a Cubby Object has multiple Order objects inside it, so it will need to store a list of all Orders.

it should be possible to choose a cubby and see all orders inside of it.
it should also be possible to retrieve the cubby from a name. may need to be done in order class.
