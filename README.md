# PickupManager
### A Management system for Pickup order storage.

Trying to learn some c++ before semester. c++ is weird.

## Use
I struggled a ton with figuring out how you compile cpp projects, I was struggling to get VSCode to work.
I settled on just compiling on my own with this. 

    g++ -o manager src/order.cpp src/main.cpp -Iinclude
